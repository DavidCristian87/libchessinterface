Compilation on Linux:

Run: ./configure && make
If no error occured, you can now run: sudo make install
Congratulations, libchessinterface is now compiled and installed!

Compilation on Windows:

The same using MinGW/MSYS (install using mingw get),
but if you can't work it out, simply use the precompiled windows dll.
